# 上院
* 一般只有15分钟准备，准备时间较少。
* 优势：先讲，论点讲得好直接打爆己方下院，（正上）定义定的好把另一方打爆
* 劣势：准备时间少，论点少的话直接白送己方下院。

# 正上 Opening Government
## PM Prime Minister: Four steps
### ①：Analyze the Motion（value debate, policy debate）
***
Eg:  
The house regret the popularity of douyin.  
THW enforce 12 years compulsory education system in China.  
THBT the US government should ban guns.  
THBT EU should banish the refugees who entered illegally.  
THBT victims of sexual abuse have the right not to disclose their own names.  
***
### ②：Define and interpret(describe) the motion   
定义和阐释辩题
* The First Government Team has the right to define and interpret the motion.
* The First Government Team has the responsibility to define and interpret the motion in a reasonable way, and to interpret the motion includes narrowing the motion for the purposes of the debate.    
确定讨论方向，窄化辩题。（己方有利，但不能过分）
***
Eg:  
Motion: Israel should change its policies toward Palestinians.  
Interpretation: For the purposes of this debate we will interpret (narrow) the motion to include only Arab citizens of the      State of Israel.  
只讨论以色列境内的巴勒斯坦人
       
Motion: The US government should ban guns.  
Interpretation: This government will focus on the influences on children's life security and mental health.  
只讨论枪支对孩子的身心健康影响
       
Motion: EU should banish the refugees who entered illegally.  
Interpretation: This government is the Greece government. We will narrow the motion to include only the financial crisis caused by plenty of refugees.  
只讨论欧洲难民对希腊国内经济等方面的影响
***
* Defining the motion includes defining anywords or phrases that:  
   -  are ambiguous 模棱两可的词
   -  might not be understood by the audience 不理解的词
***
Eg:  
Motion: Israel should change its policies toward Palestinians.   
Definition: “Palestinians” include citizens of the West Bank and Gaza as well as Arab citizens of the State of Israel.

Motion: THW enforce 12 years compulsory education system in China.   
Definition: 12 years compulsory include primary,junior and senior high education,and also include vocational school and art school education.

Motion: Inheritance tax 本院认为应该征收遗产税  
这个辩题就只需要定义本院和解释遗产税，无需做窄化
***
### ③：Present a model of the motion
辩题框架，模型 

If the motion is about a policy or action, then model should contain at least three things:
   - Who is the actor?  政策实施对象
   - What is the proposed action?  政策措施
   - Are any other details of the proposal needed?   其他细则  

If the motion is about assigning value to an Object (person, institution, idea, etc.), then the model simply needs to be a clear statement of the focus and direction for the debate.
***
Eg:  
Motion: The house regret the popularity of douyin.   
确定讨论焦点类似于窄化辩题  
比如讨论对青少年的影响 
***
### ④：Give argumentation.



## DPM Deputy Prime Minister: Supporting the Case
### ①：Providing refutation. (to be considered in a later lesson on refutation).
### ②：Add something new to the case developed by the Prime Minister.It may be a new principled argument, a new consequential argument, or more in‐depth support for an argument already presented.  
论点补充或给出新观点

## 时间分配  
首相尽可能把定义还有模型框架（背景）讲清楚，浪费个3分钟也没关系。剩下时间讲论点，论点不需要太详细，框架即可。
副首相的rebuttal时间不要太长，2-3分钟为宜，抓关键反驳，其余时间补充论点。

## DLO Deputy Leader of the Opposition
### ①：To continue the refutation.
### ②：To carry on independent arguments introduced by the Leader of the opposition.
### ③：Better give at least one new argument.

## 挑战定义 Challenge  
除非被逼急了，不然还是不要干这件事为好。  
要是挑战定义，首先要给出正上定义不合理之处（比如：让反方无话可说），然后给出己方的定义。  
至于最后排名，看下院跟谁。如果跟正上，那就第四凉了；要是跟反上，那正上就第四凉掉。顺便看裁判 
## 时间分配
2-3分钟rebuttal为宜
