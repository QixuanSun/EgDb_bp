# 正上 Opening Government
## PM Prime Minister: Four steps
### Analyze the Motion（value debate, policy debate）
***
Eg:  
The house regret the popularity of douyin.  
THW enforce 12 years compulsory education system in China.  
THBT the US government should ban guns.  
THBT EU should banish the refugees who entered illegally.  
THBT victims of sexual abuse have the right not to disclose their own names.  
***
### Define and interpret(describe) the motion   
定义和阐释辩题
* The First Government Team has the right to define and interpret the motion.
* The First Government Team has the responsibility to define and interpret the motion in a reasonable way, and to interpret the motion includes narrowing the motion for the purposes of the debate.    
确定讨论方向，窄化辩题。（己方有利，但不能过分）
***
Eg:  
Motion: Israel should change its policies toward Palestinians.  
Interpretation: For the purposes of this debate we will interpret (narrow) the motion to include only Arab citizens of the      State of Israel.  
       
Motion: The US government should ban guns.  
Interpretation: This government will focus on the influences on children's life security and mental health.  
       
Motion: EU should banish the refugees who entered illegally.  
Interpretation: This government is the Greece government. We will narrow the motion to include only the financial crisis caused by plenty of refugees.  
***
* Defining the motion includes defining anywords or phrases that:  
   -  are ambiguous 模棱两可的词
   -  might not be understood by the audience 不理解的词
***
Eg:  
Motion: Israel should change its policies toward Palestinians.   
Definition: “Palestinians” include citizens of the West Bank and Gaza as well as Arab citizens of the State of Israel.

Motion: THW enforce 12 years compulsory education system in China.   
Definition: 12 years compulsory include primary,junior and senior high education,and also include vocational school and art school education.
***
* Present a model of the motion
辩题框架，模型 

If the motion is about a policy or action, then model should contain at least three things:
   - Who is the actor?  政策实施对象
   - What is the proposed action?  政策措施
   - Are any other details of the proposal needed?   其他细则  

If the motion is about assigning value to an Object (person, institution, idea, etc.), then the model simply needs to be a clear statement of the focus and direction for the debate.
***
Eg:  
Motion: The house regret the popularity of douyin.   
确定讨论焦点类似于窄化辩题  
***
### Give argumentation.



## DPM Deputy Prime Minister: Supporting the Case
### Providing refutation. (to be considered in a later lesson on refutation).
### Add something new to the case developed by the Prime Minister.It may be a new principled argument, a new consequential argument, or more in‐depth support for an argument already presented.  
论点补充或给出新观点

## 时间分配  
首相尽可能把定义还有模型框架（背景）讲清楚，浪费个3分钟也没关系。剩下时间讲论点，论点不需要太详细，框架即可。
副首相的rebuttal时间不要太长，2-3分钟为宜，抓关键反驳，其余时间补充论点。

## Definition Practising

## LO Leader of the Opposition
### To develop the opposition stance. 建立反方立场（一句话）
### To directly or indirectly refute part or all of the Government case.(Refutation will be considered in an upcoming lesson).反驳正方框架

### To construct independent Opposition arguments. 建立反方框架
* The Government model will not solve the problems. 政府的政策模型不能解决问题

* The Proposition model will create more problems than it solves. 该政策弊大于利

* A counter proposal is better. 给出相抗政策，并说明反方的政策更好

## DLO Deputy Leader of the Opposition
### To continue the refutation.
